## Post-Mortem

 **What I learned**
Game design is a huge learning process that has both infinite possibilities and infinite ways to mess up anything you may have by the click of a button. Unless you fully understand how to code the games you have, it can take hours or even days to fix a problem with the chance of creating another. It was nice to get creative with my work and draw the characters and everything though.

 **Future Improvements**
	I hope to add more levels with a bit more difficulty and more enemies. That, and also improving upon current features I had already implemented, such as NPC dialogue and slingshot fire.
